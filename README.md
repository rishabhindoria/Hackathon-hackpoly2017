•	Configured the Facebook messenger to communicate with Heroku cloud server.

•	Deployed Node.js-index.js file on Heroku cloud platform which handled all the messages (typed by the user) that were sent to it by the Facebook messenger front end.

•	The index.js file then sent the user message to Wolfram-Alpha API.

•	Returned results from the Wolfram-Alpha API were then parsed by index.js file and then sent to Facebook messenger as a response.

•	The Facebook messenger finally then showed the results returned by index.js file to the user.
